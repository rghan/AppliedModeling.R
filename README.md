# Applied Predictive Modeling - R code examples

This is a collection of exercises adapted from [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.springer.com/statistics/life+sciences,+medicine+%26+health/book/978-1-4614-6848-6) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson.

I work through various exercises, but apply some alterations to the original code. Here, I try to use some newer R packages to more easily work with data. This was done so that I can better learn modeling, Rmarkdown and git/github.
